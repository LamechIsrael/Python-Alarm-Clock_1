# Python-Alarm-Clock_1
My first Python project. It will tell me what time it will be when the alarm is set.

I have not included input, yet. However, variables are taken within the code itself.

"currentTime" is the hour it is now.
"amPm" is the value for whether it is 'am' or 'pm' at this moment.

Once those are set, the "alarmHours" will be used to calculate when the alarm will ring.
After that, the console will tell you how many days have passed and at what time the alarm will ring.
